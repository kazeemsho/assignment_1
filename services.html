          <h3>AN EXEMPLARY TEAM</h3>
          <p>We would put our team of service technicians up against any team in the business. 
          They are tops in their field, professionals who could work in pretty much any shop they wanted. 
          They choose to work at Sewell because we pay exceptionally well, cover all ongoing training (most service departments make the technicians foot the bill for at least part of their training), and provide clean, comfortable, and safe working conditions. It is easy to see one way this pays off for the customer - in service performed right the first time. But there is another benefit too: Professionals at the top of their game work quickly and efficiently, making it more cost-effective and convenient for our customer.
          </p>
